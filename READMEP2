CSE 6341: Lisp Interpreter Project 2

Student Name: Fei Xiao (xiao.466)


(1) How to compile the code?
	The code is writen in C++11. To compile the code, just type "make" in your command line, 
	then the code will be compiled.

(2) How to run the code?
	After making, there is a file called 'lisp', which is the main program.
	To run the program, using program 'lisp' with your input file name, for example:
	
	>>	./lisp test.txt

	This command will take the input file text.txt and write the output into file 'output.txt'.
	The output.txt contains the result of each s-expression in order, as well as the evaluation. 
	If the s-expression is illegal, the output file will show an error message at the corresponding place.
